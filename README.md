# So_long

The goal of this projct is to create a basic computer game, improving my skills in window management, event handling, dealing with colors and textures.

I used the school's graphical library, MiliLibX and created my 2D art and animation!

The game needs to have a player that collects X items and then exits. There must be obstacles and walls around the map. My idea was for the player to be a happy dog in a messy house, gathering socks around the place.
